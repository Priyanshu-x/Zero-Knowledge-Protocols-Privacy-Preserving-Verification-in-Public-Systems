# Zero-Knowledge Protocols: Privacy-Preserving Verification in Public Systems

## Project Description

This project demonstrates the implementation of zero-knowledge proof concepts through a blockchain-based verification system. The smart contract enables users to prove knowledge of secrets and verify credentials without revealing sensitive information, showcasing the fundamental principles of privacy-preserving verification in decentralized systems.

The system implements three core verification mechanisms:
- **Secret Commitment & Verification**: Users can commit to secrets and later prove knowledge without revealing the actual secret
- **Zero-Knowledge Proof Simulation**: Demonstrates cryptographic proof verification concepts
- **Privacy-Preserving Age Verification**: Allows users to prove they meet age requirements without disclosing their actual age

## Project Vision

Our vision is to create a foundation for privacy-preserving identity and credential verification systems that can be integrated into various decentralized applications. By implementing zero-knowledge proof concepts on the blockchain, we aim to:

- Enable secure identity verification without compromising user privacy
- Demonstrate practical applications of cryptographic proof systems
- Provide a template for building privacy-first decentralized applications
- Bridge the gap between theoretical cryptography and real-world implementation
